# Plex Butler

Plex Butler is a companion to the official Plex App. It was written specifically for my personal
use and adds some features that I think are missing from the official app. That said, feel free to use it.

The features it adds include:
* Quick wathced/unwatched toggle with no confimration.
* Fix Match & Unmatch  a Show/Movie.
* Initiate a server library rescan.
* Show IMDB Link if found.
* Add a show to a SickRage server.
